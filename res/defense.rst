To defend in this game you have a good bit of options. Let’s go over them to bring you up to speed!

Blocking
########
Done by either holding back and downback. Holding downback is typically encouraged as it will help defend from low attacks. Be careful as blocking too long will drain your guard bar and once depleted you will be put into guard crush state and be open to attacks

* EX guard: Ex guard is done by tapping back or downback as the opponent attacks you. This is a very important mechanic as it applies more pushback to the offender and also restores some of your guard bar. H moon cannot EX guard and that’s the only moon that cannot do that so they get a higher guard bar as a result.

Shield
######
Shield is performed by pressing D. A regular shield allows you to cancel into a special move or an EX move. Cmoon ex shield allows you to cancel into normals, specials,ex and even jump. F moon does have ex shield but they still can only cancel into special moves and EX.

An important thing to note is that F moon can hold shield and if shielded successfully you can input 236D to do a shield counter. C moon can hold shield as well but does not have a shield counter and H moon cannot hold shield at all and does an auto shield counter when a strike hits it. If a projectile hits your shield you then have to manually input 236D to do a shield counter.

* Shield Bunker:  done by inputting 214D either out of blockstun or during blockstun. If done during blockstun it take 50 meter for c/f moon to do a metered bunker. That bunker is not HKD and you can tech after getting hit by c/f bunker. H moon takes 100 meter but does put the opponent in HKD.

Dodge
#####
Done by doing 2A+B/2E, this allows your character to fade into the background and dodge strikes but is vulnerable to throws. This option is only available to C and H moon.

Heat/Circuit Spark
##################
Heat is a move that’s done by pressing A+B+C and creates a shockwave and also heals you. C moon can do this anytime they have 100 meter while F can only do it in MAX mode (reached 300 meter), H moon does not have heat and instead has an auto heat mode when they reach 200 meter. C moon heals over times while in heat while F moon heals instantly

When you heat while in MAX mode(300 meter) you then go into Blood Heat and now gain access to options such as Another Arc drive and Last Arc.

* Circuit Spark: While in MAX mode, if you input A+B+C while you are getting hit you will burst and break the combo. Be careful as this can be baited.
