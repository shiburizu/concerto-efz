Welcome to Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code.

Need to know where to start? How to move? How to press buttons? Yeah, we get it and we’ll show the ropes so stick along so you don’t miss a beat! Before we even begin talking about even the basics we should recount our buttons, right?

Numpad notation
###############
Melty's moves and combo sequences are notated with a combination of button letters and numbers, known as Numpad Notation. First of all, the game has 5 buttons: A, B, C, D, and E. 

Look at the number pad below and note that each number represents a direction. 5 represents the lever neutral position, and 6 always faces the same direction the character is facing for consistency. 

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

By representing lever directions with numerals as shown above, any set of lever and button inputs can be represented with a combination of button letters and numbers. Additionally, moves are given prefixes to signify certain properties, such a j. for "performed in midair". More information on notation specifics can be found in the Notation Glossary. 

Controls
########
* A, B, and C correspond to weak, medium, and heavy attacks respectively.

* The D button functions as shield, which is a parry mechanism. Specifics of the D button vary with the Moon style.

  * 236D/j.236D (After successful Shield): Launching counter hit follow up. Can be guarded if timed right. (Full moon only)
  * 214D (Can be done while blocking): Shield Bunker. (All moons, though Half has a unique Shield Bunker when done while blocking.)

* The E button (labeled "QA" ("Quick Action") in game config) is the in-game macro button which outputs different button combinations depending on the direction held (regardless of the character's state). Does not do anything on diagonals.

  * 5E: Acts as A+B+C.
  * [Ground Only] Activate Heat or Blood Heat (Crescent), Circuit Charge or Active Blood Heat (Full).
  * [Ground/Air] (while blocking/being hit) Circuit Spark (Crescent, Full; Half in a special case).
  * 4/6E: Acts as A+D (resulting in 4/6A+D)
  * Throw/Air Throw and Throw Tech .
  * 2E: Acts as A+B. Results in 2A+B.
  * Dodge and Air Dodge (Crescent, Half).

The only direction/button combination that can't be done with the E button is 4/6A+B or j.4/6 A+B, which gives you a dash/backdash or airdash/airbackdash. 

What are Moons?
###############
Throughout this guide you will see reference to Crescent, Half and Full Moons. These are the 3 selectable gameplay styles which are chosen by each player at character select. These are often abbreviated to simply "C", "H" and "F" with the character suffixed to represent the moon and character choice. 

For example, Aoko with Crescent Moon style chosen is written as C-Aoko. Refer to the Moon Styles article for a full explanation of the differences between each Moon Style.
