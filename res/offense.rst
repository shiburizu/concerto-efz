In this portion there is quite a bit of variance depending on what moon you pick. Refer to the Moon Styles page for more.

In Melty Blood you are allowed to do what is called chains. To do chains you just press the lower strength button to the highest strength button in succession, rapidly even. The order goes like this: A>B>C 

All characters can do this and this also goes for the air chains as well. If a character has a command normal you can do it after a c normal is pressed. A basic example would be F-Roa:
2A>2B>5C>6C

Another thing that all moon variants can do is called whiff cancel. This can only be done from whiffing an A normal. You can cancel from whiffing an A normal into either a B or C normal or even a special, EX, or even AD.

Reverse Beat
############

One thing about Melty is unique in its offense is the ability to reverse beat or "rebeat", the ability to go back to a previously lesser strength button. Only C and H moon can do this. This means being able to chain buttons like 5B back to 5A or 2A. Not only does this really make offense more varied but also can keep you safe in situations where ending your blockstring on a C button would leave you to be minus.

Throws
######

In addition, throws done by inputting 6/4A+D. You also get air throws by inputting 6/4A+D in the air. The unique thing about Melty is that you can end combos with your air throw. You can also start combos if you landed a raw airthrow. 

Special Moves
#############
These moves are performed in melty by usually involving a motion input + A/B/ Some special moves do different things depending on the strength of the button used. 

EX moves require at least 100% of your meter and is done by doing the motion input + C. Each EX move per character does very different effects. 

Arc Drive, Another Arc Drive & Last Arc
#######################################

* Arc Drive: This move requires you to be in MAX mode (300% meter, it will change the meter bar to yellow as it slowly drains) generally the input is 41236+C but some characters may have an additional such as Hisui&Kohaku(team).

* Another Arc drive: Itâ€™s the same input and is the more damaging version of the arc drive. It requires you to be in Blood Heat. 

* Last Arc: For Last Arc to activate, you need to be in Blood Heat and successfully EX shield an attack, once done it will activate the Last Arc. The effects of a Last Arc could be just massive amounts of damage or also gives different effects.
