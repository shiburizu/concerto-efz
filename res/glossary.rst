Standard Terms and Abbreviations

* Another Arc-Drive (AAD): 41236C in BLOOD HEAT will activate another, usually stronger, version of the Arc-Drive. Using it will deplete all your remaining Magic Circuit.

* Arc-Drive (AD): 41236C in HEAT or MAX will activate a character's special move. Using it in HEAT will deplete all your remaining Magic Circuit, in MAX it will leave you with 100% Magic Circuit.

* Blockstring: Strings (usually airtight) of attacks that get blocked.

* Bunker: Inputting 214D with any moon characters. When used during guarding/blocking, your character will attempt to clash the oncoming opponent's attack and follow up with a unique bunker attack. For half moon characters, this attack has invincibility frames, knocks down without dealing damage, and costs 100% meter. For other moon characters, this attack deals damage and costs 50% meter.
  
  * When done outside blocking, the characters does a quick EX shield and then follows up with the damaging version of the bunker (even if you are using half moon style). This does not cost any meter, but degrades guard bar. Has a clash frame on startup.

* Circuit Break: Certain moves put the opponent (and, rarely, the player) in a state where they can't gain or use meter. Their Magic Circuit meter becomes cracked and purple and have the words "Circuit Break" on it, with the bar indicating how long the state will last. Any meter they had before will be kept after the Circuit Break ends.

* Counter Hit (CH): When a move hits the opponent while they have a move out during its startup or active frames. Puts the opponent in a longer period of hitstun and untech time than a normal hit, and may even knock them down. Some moves and actions can be counter hit during recovery too, making them much riskier to use.

* Cross-Up: Passing over the opponent and hitting their back while they are facing the wrong way. Because of the cross-up protection Melty has, when this happens the opponent can block both ways without worrying about getting hit.

* Dodge and Air-Dodge: 2E or 2A+B causes the character to shine and become invincible for a short time. However, it has recovery, so it is not possible to dodge every attack. A dodge weakens the guard bar, so it shouldn't be overly relied upon for defense.
  
  * Some characters' ground dodges are actually rolls that moves your character toward a direction. This can be used to go behind the opponent.

  * Air dodges have uses outside that of just avoiding the opponent's attack. They can be used to realign your character to face the opponent in air during combos or for cross ups.

* Frame Trap: A sequence of moves in which one (usually advantageous on block) attack is used, followed by a second one that hits as soon as the opponent's hit/block stun ends. This leaves a very small gap during which if the opponent tries to use a move such as 2A, they will get counter hit during their startup by the frame trap's next attack. This can also be referred to as Stagger Pressure in blockstrings.

* Guard Bar: The short blue bar you see below the life bar. This will deplete whenever you guard (holding 4 or 1) your opponent's attacks. Successful EX guards replenish the bar instead. If it is completely depleted, the guard is crushed.
  * After the first air dodge or whiffed shield, the bar turns reddish gray. The second time, it turns completely red. The redder the guard bar, the weaker it is to attacks. An attack that dealt certain blue guard bar damage will deal several times more to a red guard bar. Thankfully, the guard bar gradually returns to its original blue status over time.

* Guard Crush: A state where the character becomes immobile and helpless after their guard bar is fully depleted. The guard bar rapidly refills after the guard crush. Called "Guard Break" in-game.

* HEAT, MAX and BLOOD HEAT: HEAT is a state entered by pressing 5ABC or 5E with at least 100% Magic Circuit. While in HEAT, red life slowly regenerates. Arc-Drives can be used in HEAT mode. Similarly, in MAX mode both Arc-Drives and Circuit Sparks can be used, but without the regenerative effects of HEAT. Lastly, BLOOD HEAT is entered when pressing 5ABC or 5E when in MAX. Health regerates faster and both Another Arc-Drives or Last-Arcs can be used.
  * Note that there are differences regarding HEAT among the 3 moon styles. Please read the Moon Styles page for more info.

* Initiative Heat (IH): It's like a Roman Cancel in GG, only accessible by Full Moon characters in Max mode. Press A+B+C during an attack to cancel the current attack animation and return to a neutral state -- can also be done in the air. Doing this will instantly heal all red life into yellow life and return the character to "Heat" mode.

* Instant Air (Back)Dash (IAD/IABD): This is a way to perform an airdash as soon as you leave the ground, its input is 6956 / 4754.

* Last-Arc (LA): Successfully EX-Shielding an opponent's attack while crouching, standing or in mid-air (this depends on the character performing the Last-Arc) will activate a special attack that usually pauses the opponent's movements and counter attacks for great damage.

* Magic Circuit: Also called Circuit Meter or just Meter. Read the Circuit Meter page for more info.

* Meaty: Using an attack as an opponent is waking, forcing them to block. Characters can use invincible starup reversals or shields to beat the technique.

* Mix-Up: Technique used to make an opponent guess between two or more different actions that require different reactions, such a followup attack that could either be a low or an overhead attack.

* Moon Styles: There are 3 different moon styles: Crescent Moon, Half Moon and Full Moon. These are abbreviated with C, H and F respectively. These abbreviations are also used when referring to a character in a specific mode, e.g. C-Nanaya, H-Ryougi, F-Kohaku etc. Please read the Moon Styles page for more info on the differences among the moon styles.

* Okizeme: Set-play done on the opponent's wakeup.

* Option Select (OS): A command usually consisting of several buttons that will perform a different action depending on what the opponent's own action.

* OTG: A state where you can still be hit while On The Ground. Usually used to refer to strings performed on downed opponents.

* Safejump: A jump-in attack used as a meaty. Referred to as safejump for being safe against reversal attacks as landing will cancel your aerial normal's recovery and let you quickly block or just out-space any wake-up attacks such as invulnerable DPs. However, as per the landing recovery rules, only Full Moon characters can instantly block on landing.

* Sandoori/Sandori: Term used to denote the side switch air dash motion to bypass the cross-up protection. After crossing up it's usually inputted as 6954 or 4756 (Both notations are relative to the side you were in before crossing). The term is an abbreviation of the word "Sandaa Dorifuto" (サンダー・ドリフト) which is a Japanese pronunciation of the word "Thunder Drift". This has been commonly mistaken to denote 3-way mixups due to "sandoori" being misinterpreted as "Three way".

* Shield and EX-Shield: D in air and ground. When shielding, one hit of an incoming attack is nullified. EX shield is a shield done right before the attack connects. Holding shield drains meter rapidly, so its unwise unless the benefit outweighs the cost. When the first hit of certain muti-hit attacks are shielded, you will automatically shield all subsequent hits (known as auto-shielding).
  
  * Some attacks must be shielded standing or crouching, similar to guarding. Be aware that there are low attacks that can be shielded high and vice versa. Some attacks (mostly grabs) are unshieldable.

  * A successful shield grants 5% meter, and the attacker receives no meter while forced to complete the attack animation. Thus, hitting the unfortunate opponent after a shield (usually with a shield counter 236D) usually results in a counter hit.

* Startup: After inputting a move, it is the amount of frames that must pass prior to reaching the active frames. Otherwise known as "True Startup" as it does not include the first active frame.

* Teching: Recovery from midair hitstun or knockdown performed by pressing a button and a direction in midair, pressing a direction right before hitting the ground, or pressing a direction after an OTG attack. Vulnerable to attack (tech trapping/punishing). Some characters can set up near unescapable tech trap situations.

* The Neutral Frame: The Neutral Frame is a frame that nearly all actions must pass through after the recovery frames. On this frame, one can block and tech throws, but not act otherwise.

* Tick Throw: A throw performed after getting a fast attack blocked, usually 5a/2a. The throw is delayed to avoid the 7f throw protection window after blockstun.

* Tiger knee (TK): When an aerial move (such as j.236) is input on the ground before a jump (with 2369X/2367X/2368X) for use as close to the ground as possible. Changes usage for some moves and may even change recovery. More examples include: 2149X/2148X/2147X, 4219X/4218X/4217X, etc

* Which-way: Ambiguous mixup involving a combination of left/right and high/low mixups.
