Commands will assume facing right, and using numpad notation.

Now before we even begin to run we have to learn to walk.
 
Walking
#######
In Melty, you have the ability to walk backward or forward by pressing/holding forward or backward on your controller. Relatively simple right? Let’s try to run now.

Dashing/Backdash
################
Dashing is done by pressing forward twice(66) or pressing 6A+B in quick succession and that makes your character dart across the screen, being faster than walking. Some character’s dashes are like step dashes where they go a set distance and others are run types where you can hold forward after inputting it twice to run across the screen.

Backdashing is done by pressing backwards(44) twice or by inputting 4A+B. Backdashes have invincibility as well, although character’s backdash distance varies. Use it to escape out of the opponent’s range.

Jumping
#######
One of the most important tools in melty to use to aid your approaches in the game. Let’s go over every bit in detail:

* Jump: To jump you press up in any direction whether it's up forward(9), straight up(8) or up backwards(7).

* Jump drift: you can alter your aerial movement during your jump by jumping straight up(8) and then holding forward or backwards. This changes your air momentum.

* Super jump: To super jump you would press down then quickly press up. You can only super jump straight up(2,8) or forward(2,9).

* Double jump: After doing a single jump input up in any directions as stated previously, some characters even get triple jumps like C-Aoko.

* Super double jump: done by tapping down and the forward(2,9) after a jump. During combos you can just tap up forward(9) and that will give you super double jump during the combo. You can only super jump forward.

* Airdash: the two ways to input it are 6956 or 96A+B. This allows you to travel through the air swiftly. Not all airdashes are the same however and some characters even get two such as Aoko, and V-Akiha.

* Dodge/Airdodge: is done by doing 2A+B/2E, this allows your character to fade into the background and dodge strikes but is vulnerable to throws. This option is only available to C and H moon. Airdodge is very good to reposition yourself in the air to face the opponent correctly.
